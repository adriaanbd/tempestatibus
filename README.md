# Tempestatibus
This is a mini Weather App with JS using the free [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) with Fetch API via `node-fetch` in an effort to explore JS's async features with `promises`.

## Getting started

### Get credentials
1. Go to [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), signup and request an API key.
2. Create a file named `.env` and insert your APP id in here as a `key=value`, i.e.: `APP_ID=ABC123APPID`

The above-mentioned steps are importante because the app won't work without your credentials, as they are required by the Open Weather API.

### Install dependencies and run server

3. Install dependencies: `$ npm install`
4. Run server: `$ npm run start`

### Make your query and view results

4. Insert city
5. Select unit of temperature: `Celsius` or `Fahrenheit`
6. Submit query
7. View results
